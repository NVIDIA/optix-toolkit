# UdimTextureViewer sample

The udimTextureViewer demonstrates how to create an use UDIM texture (arrays of texture images treated as a single texture) in the OptiX demand loading library. This sample can also stress the texturing system by allocating large arrays of textures.  For example, the command 

```
udimTextureViewer --texdim=8192x8192 --udim=32x32
```

creates an array of 32x32 textures, each with resolution 8192x8192. Fully 
loaded, these textures would require is 1.33 TB of GPU storage.
