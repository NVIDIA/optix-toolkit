The stochasticTextureFiltering sample implements stochastic texture filtering in the context
of demand load textures.  Stochastic filtering allows an application to probabilistically simulate higher
order filters (bicubic, Gaussian, EWA, Lanczos...), by jittering samples taken from a low order
interpolation method (point or linear).
