/** \mainpage Overview

The OptiX Demand Loading library allows hardware-accelerated sparse textures to be loaded on demand,
which greatly reduces memory requirements, bandwidth, and disk I/O compared to preloading textures.

It works by maintaining a page table that tracks which texture tiles have been loaded into GPU
memory. An OptiX closest-hit program fetches from a texture by calling library device code
(e.g. \ref tex2DGrad) that checks the page table to see if the required tiles are present. If not,
the library records a page request, which is processed by library host code after the kernel has
terminated. Kernel launches are repeated until no tiles are missing, typically using adaptive
sampling to avoid redundant work. Although it is currently focused on texturing, much of the library
is generic and can be adapted to load arbitrary data on demand, such as per-vertex data like colors
or normals.

This document describes the Demand Loading API.  For a higher-level discussion, please see the

The DemandLoader class is the primary interface of the Demand Loading library.  Here is some sample
code (adapted from examples/DemandLoading/simple) that demonstrates how to launch a kernel that
requests a demand-loaded resource:

\code
    // Create DemandLoader and a demand-loaded resource.
    DemandLoader* loader    = createDemandLoader( Options() );
    unsigned int  startPage = loader->createResource( numPages, callback );

    // Prepare for launch, obtaining DeviceContext.
    DeviceContext context;
    loader->launchPrepare( deviceIndex, stream, context );

    // Launch the kernel, using the DeviceContext to make page requests.
    myKernel<<<numBlocks, threadsPerBlock, 0U, stream>>>( context );

    // Initiate request processing, which returns a Ticket.
    Ticket ticket = loader->processRequests( deviceIndex, stream, context );

    // Wait for any page requests to be processed.
    ticket.wait();

    // Launch the kernel again, using the DeviceContext to locate the requested pages.
    myKernel<<<numBlocks, threadsPerBlock, 0U, stream>>>( context );

    // Clean up.
    destroyDemandLoader( loader );
\endcode
