///
/// Invoke a functor at a specific launch index for debugging purposes.  The functor takes the OptiX launch index
/// at which debugging information is desired.  Generally the functor is a lambda that captures application
/// state (or references or pointers to such state) to be dumped via printf at the specific launch index.
/// A red pixel is drawn at the debug launch index, with a 2 pixel black border around the debug launch index
/// and a further 2 pixel white border around that.  This makes a single red pixel easy to spot in the output.
/// Pixels are set via the given function pointer, which generally just sets the ray payload to the appropriate
/// values.  If no visible output is desired, then simply supply a lambda that does nothing with the 3 float values.
/// The dump function is taken as a template parameter to allow the use of lambdas that capture application state
/// as we don't have access to std::function<> to make a generic callable.  The set color routine is taken as a
/// simple function pointer because it is assumed to not need to capture any application state in order to set
/// a ray payload.
///
/// A "one-shot" debug information dump mechanism can be implemented as follows:
/// - Enable the debug dump mechanism and set the debug launch index and the set flag.
/// - Launch with dumpSuppressed set to false and the debug output will be printed
/// - Set dumpSuppressed to true and subsequent launches will display the debug location,
///   but will not emit debug output.
///
/// This allows you to get visual indication of the debug location in the rendered image without repeated
/// output of the same debug information over and over again as frames are rendered.  This is most useful in
/// an application where the rendered image only changes due to user interaction and therefore the debug output
/// is static across many frames.
///
/// @param  debug       The DebugLocation structure containing enable flags and debug launchIndex.
/// @param  dumpFn      The function to be invoked when the launch index matches.
///         setColor    The function invoked to set colors for the debug pixel and its border.
///
/// @returns            Returns true if a debug color was set at the current launch index.
